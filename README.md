Core is an Autoclicker tool for Windows.

THIS IS THE OLD VERSION OF CORE THAT WILL NOT BE UPDATED ANYMORE. NO NEW FEATURES, NO BUG FIXES.
IF YOU WANT TO GET FREQUENT UPDATES AND A LOT OF MORE FEATURES, GO TO https://github.com/domaah/Core-X/

IMPORTANT: 
Core requires .NET 4.5 and .NET 6.0 to launch.
Please install those 2 before installation of Core.
